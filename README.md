# Singly Linked List Container  
Due:  Date listed on Canvas
***  
This assignment is to be completed on your own. Refer to the plagiarism policy in the syllabus.  

You are not allowed to use any libraries or functions that we have not discussed in class.  
***  

For this project, you will be writing a linked list container that will store information about a student’s pending homework assignments. **This list must always be kept in order by the date that an assignment is due.**  

To get you started on this project, the Date class that you have used has been altered so that it can now have a date object set to today, using the computer’s internal clock.  

In the same file, there is a new class called DateTime, which records the hour and minute when something happened as well as a date.  

Using these two, a class called Assignment is defined, which records:  
* the name of an assignment (a string)  
* the course the assignment is for (a string)  
* the date/time the assignment was entered (a DateTime)  
* the date/time when the assignment is due (a DateTime)  

The overloaded comparison operators for the Assignment class are based on the date/time an assignment is due, so if assignment1 < assignment2 it means that assignment1 is due before assignment2, disregarding name, course, and time the assignment was entered.  

You should begin the project by cloning your repository and getting familiar with the starter files.

Your task is to create the header and implementation files for the Planner class. This class will store a list of assignments that the student needs to complete. This list is stored in the form of a linked list of nodes. **I have given you the node class you are to use.** The internal list must be kept in order by the assignment due date, but the people who enter assignments into the list may not be recording them in that order. This means that when a new assignment is added, you will need to search through the list to put it in the correct place. All comparison operators are overloaded for the Assignment class to facilitate this.  

The Planner class will offer the application programmer the following options:
1.	Add a new Assignment to the list.  
2.	View the entire list of Assignments, in the order they are stored.  
3.	Remove an assignment that has been completed. This will use the find and remove functions, both of which will take a string (the name of the assignment).  
4.	View the number of assignments that are waiting to be completed (the length of the list).  
5.	See the amount of time you have to complete the assignment that is due soonest. (This assignment should be at the front of the list.)  
6.	See the average amount of time that assignments have been sitting in the list since they were entered.  
7.	Identify the assignment that has been in the list the longest.  
8.	Identify the assignment that was added to the list most recently.  
9.	See all assignments that must be completed by a date entered by the user.  

***  

The main that I have given you has a menu demonstrating all these options, and you should be able discern the names and parameters for the required functions from the calls that you see in the main. There are also test cases you can run on your own using "make run_tests".  

You will also need to have a load function and a save function that saves simply the information about the assignments, not the size of the list. The data file should be formatted as such for each assignment:

```
assignment name
course
date the assignment was entered
time the assignment was entered
date the assignment is due
time the assignment is due
```
 
Since linked lists are built using dynamic memory, your Planner class will be “holding” dynamic memory and that means that you will need to implementation the Big 3.  

There are some useful functions already implemented for you. Descriptions are provided in the header files:  
* Date::age()  
* Date::make_today()  
* Date::minutes_since_1970()  
* DateTime::input()
* DateTime::output()
* DateTime::make_now()  
* DateTime::minutes_since_1970()  
* Assignment::minutes_til_due()  
* Assignment::minutes_waiting()  
* Date, DateTime, and Assignment comparison operators
* Date and Assignment >> and << operators  

***  

Your final commit message should be along the lines of **"Finished, ready to grade. run-tests"**.  

**Your final GitHub repository should include:** Your planner.h and planner.cc files along with the data file you were testing with. All code should be adequately documented and neatly formatted according to the guidelines given in the coding standard resources provided on Canvas. Submit a link to your repository on Canvas when you are finished with the assignment.
